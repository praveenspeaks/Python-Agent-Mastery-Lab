LangChain Project Demo
====================
LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs).
As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.

History
----------
LangChain was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence.
The project quickly garnered popularity, with hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively servers on Discord, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London.
In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, weeks after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.
